### 5.3 Academic integrity
Murdoch University expects students and staff to pursue the highest standards of integrity in all academic activity. Academic integrity involves behaving ethically and honestly in scholarship and relies on respect for others’ ideas through proper acknowledgement and referencing of publications. 
Academic misconduct is treated seriously and penalties may apply. 
More information about academic integrity can be found at https://goto.murdoch.edu.au/AcademicIntegrity. To help you learn about academic integrity practices, all students are required to complete the [Murdoch Academic Passport (MAP100)](https://goto.murdoch.edu.au/murdochacademicpassport). Please also note the [library citation guide](http://goto.murdoch.edu.au/referencing).

See the assessment details above for any specific expectations.
#### 5.3.2 Text matching software (Turnitin)
Murdoch University makes use of content matching software or other forms of comparison to identify unoriginal, incorrectly referenced, or uncited text.

You will be required to agree to the Turnitin [End-User License Agreement](https://guides.turnitin.com/hc/en-us/articles/29025093477901-Turnitin-End-User-License-Agreement) when submitting.
